This project is generally dedicated to visualizing [Pharo](http://www.pharo-project.org/home) grammar. That's why .dot file is present in the repository. You can visualize .dot file with [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org). The grammar itself is made in ANTLR and I have almost no idea about this technology, so any suggestions and contributions are welcome!
